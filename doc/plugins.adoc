= Plugin System

Hashmal has a plugin system that uses the `entry points` interface provided by `setuptools`.
See https://github.com/mazaclub/hashmal/wiki/Plugins[the wiki] for more information.

== Plugins

A plugin is a module containing the function `make_plugin()`, which returns an instance of
the class `Plugin` defined in `hashmal_lib.plugins.base`.

A `Plugin` instance is initialized with a class representing a dock widget.
This is subject to change.
