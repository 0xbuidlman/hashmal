Use at own risk!

## Key Features

- Write scripts in human-readable form.
- Observe the stack as scripts are executed.
- See explanations of script operations as they are evaluated.

## To-Do

- When evaluating scripts, `OP_CHECKSIG`/`OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY` cannot be used because they require a transaction in addition to the script.
